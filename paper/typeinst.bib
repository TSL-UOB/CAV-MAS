abstract = { Energy is a scarce resource in real-time embedded systems due to the fact that most of them run on batteries. Hence, the designers should ensure that the energy constraints are satisfied in addition to the deadline constraints. This necessitates the consideration of the impact of the interference due to shared, low-level hardware resources such as the cache on the worst-case energy consumption of the tasks. Toward this aim, this article proposes a fine-grained approach to analyze the bank-level interference (bank conflict and bus access interference) on real-time multicore systems, which can reasonably estimate runtime interferences in shared cache and yield tighter worst-case energy consumption. In addition, we develop a bank-to-core mapping algorithm for reducing bank-level interference and improving the worst-case energy consumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can improve the tightness of worst-case energy consumption by 14.25\% on average compared to upper-bound delay approach. The bank-to-core mapping provides significant benefits in worst-case energy consumption reduction with 7.23\%. }

abstract = "Abstract Promoting energy efficiency to a first class system design goal is an important research challenge. Although more energy-efficient hardware can be designed, it is software that controls the hardware; for a given system the potential for energy savings is likely to be much greater at the higher levels of abstraction in the system stack. Thus the greatest savings are expected from energy-aware software development, which is the vision of the \{EU\} \{ENTRA\} project. This article presents the concept of energy transparency as a foundation for energy-aware software development. We show how energy modelling of hardware is combined with static analysis to allow the programmer to understand the energy consumption of a program without executing it, thus enabling exploration of the design space taking energy into consideration. The paper concludes by summarising the current and future challenges identified in the \{ENTRA\} project. "

abstract = "Abstract With the increase in the number of cores in processor chips observed in recent years, design choices—such as the number of cores in chip, the amount of resources per core, and whether to design homogeneous or heterogeneous chips—need to be given proper support. Several studies on heterogeneous multi-core processors are concerned with performance improvements. In this work, we propose mathematical models to analyze some of these design issues with focus on the reduction of processor dynamic energy. In particular, these models allow the comparison of the dynamic-energy consumption of multi-core architectures when they execute a workload in the same amount of time while allowing different core operating frequency between the compared architectures. The results of the analysis allow chip designers to choose the right conditions for optimal energy savings in heterogeneous multi-core chips based on the parallel fraction of the workloads and on the distributions of the resources among the cores in the chip. Under a simplified context, the devised models agree with the consolidated knowledge that heterogeneous multi-core chips have considerable advantage over homogeneous multi-core and single-core architectures in terms of energy efficiency.
